// if annual income is greater than 250,000 then concessional super contributions are taxed at 30%

// Taxation on super is 15%

// CGT inside of super is 15%
//

// Max non-concessional contribution is $100,000 -> afterwards a tax of 47%
// You can use the "bring forward rule" to contribute more in a short burst within a 3 year window
// by consuming the next two year's caps.
